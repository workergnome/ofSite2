#### openFrameworks is designed to assist the creative process by providing a framework for experimentation.

We've designed openFrameworks to work as general purpose glue, wrapping together several commonly used libraries, including:

* [OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org/), [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/), [GLUT](http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/), [libtess2](https://code.google.com/p/libtess2/) and [cairo](http://cairographics.org/) for graphics
* [rtAudio](http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtaudio/), [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/), [OpenAL](http://http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal) and [Kiss FFT](http://kissfft.sourceforge.net/) or [FMOD](http://www.fmod.org/) for audio input, output and analysis
* [FreeType](http://freetype.sourceforge.net/index2.html) for fonts
* [FreeImage](http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/) for image saving and loading
* [Quicktime](http://developer.apple.com/quicktime/), [GStreamer](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) and [videoInput](https://github.com/ofTheo/videoInput) for video playback and grabbing
* [Poco](http://pocoproject.org/) for a variety of utilities
* [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) for computer vision
* [Assimp](http://assimp.sourceforge.net/) for 3D model loading

We've written the code to be massively cross-compatible. Currently we support five operating systems (Windows, OSX, Linux, iOS, Android) and four IDEs (XCode, Code::Blocks, and Visual Studio and Eclipse). The API is designed to be minimal and easy to grasp.

openFrameworks is distributed under the [MIT License](license.html). This gives everyone the freedoms to use openFrameworks in any context: commercial or non-commercial, public or private, open or closed source. While many openFrameworks users give their work back to the community in a similarly free way, there is no obligation to contribute.

Simply put, openFrameworks is a tool that makes it much easier to make things with code. We find it super useful, and we hope you do too.
