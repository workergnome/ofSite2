    using_git: "We use git, a distributed versioning system, which means also that people can branch, experiment, and make suggestions. If you look at the network diagram on %{github}, it's looks like some alien diagram, full of weaving branches, code pulling apart and coming together. There's a huge community, all over the world, working on the core code: fixing bugs, submitting pull requests, and shaping the tool the way they want to see it."
